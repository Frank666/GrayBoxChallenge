# GrayBox Challenge documentation

This readme file is just a quick guide for the challenge develop in React for GrayBox

## Specifications

1. Frontend project
2. ReactJs
  2.1 React Hooks
  2.2 Axios
3. Repo url: https://github.com/Frank666/GrayBoxChallenge.git

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository and open you fav IDE 

2. Open a terminal and run the command: `npm install` to retrieve all the dependencies for this project

3. Once is done just run the command: `npm start` and the project will run in `http://localhost:3000` :)

## Notes

In order to consume the data from the API `http://codetestjson.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kittens.json` I used a proxy to retrieve the data.

My guess is because this endpoint is a `http` instead a `https`request
